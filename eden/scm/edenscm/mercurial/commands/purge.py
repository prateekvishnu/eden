    """delete untracked files

    Delete all untracked files in your checkout. Untracked files are files
    that are unknown to Mercurial. They are marked with "?" when you run
    :hg:`status`.

    By default, :hg:`purge` does not affect::

    - Modified and unmodified tracked files
    - Ignored files (unless --all is specified)
    - New files added to the repository with :hg:`add`, but not yet committed
    - Empty directories that contain no files (unless --dirs is specified)

    If directories are given on the command line, only files in these
    directories are considered.

    Caution: Be careful with purge, as you might irreversibly delete some files
    you forgot to add to the repository. There is no way to undo an
    :hg:`purge` operation. Run :hg:`status` first to verify the list of
    files that will be deleted, or use the --print option with :hg:`purge`
    to preview the results.

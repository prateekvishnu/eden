//! treestate - Tree-based State.
//!
//! The tree state stores a map from paths to a lightweight structure, and provides efficient
//! lookups.  In particular, for each file in the tree, it stores the mode flags, size, mtime, and
//! whether deleted or not, etc. These can be useful for source control to determine if the file
//! is tracked, or has changed, etc.

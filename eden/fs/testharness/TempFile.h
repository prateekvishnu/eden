/*
 * This file contains helper functions for creating temporary files and
 * directories.  These are small utilities that use folly's TemporaryDirectory
 * and TemporaryFile underneath.
 *
 * The main advantage of these functions is that they try to do smarter job
 * about picking a location for temporary files.  Many of the Eden tests are
 * somewhat I/O heavy, and the tests can be quite slow if the temporary files
 * are stored on a physical spinning disk.  This attempts to put temporary files
 * in ramdisk if possible.
